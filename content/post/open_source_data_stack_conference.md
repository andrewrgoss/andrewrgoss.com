In September 2021 I attended an excellent virtual conference, the <a href="https://www.opensourcedatastack.com" target=_>Open Source Data Stack Conference</a>. The conference profiled a number of platforms that can be combined together to form a modern open source data stack.

The emergence of the modern data stack has seen a rapid spike in the number of data tools an organization can use to drive better decision making. Each tool has become highly specialized in its portion of the data lifecycle, plus tools that are open source are a powerful way for technology buyers to reduce exposure to vendor lock-in.

Open-source software helps you to control the end-to-end flow of customer data throughout your organization:

* To guarantee data auditability
* To allow data governance
* To support consumer data privacy
* To enable productive engineer workflows
* By taking ownership and control over your data pipeline through open source, you can reduce the “trust surface area” for your customer data.

Through numerous real world examples, the presenters at this conference demonstrated how teams can build a data stack that reflects their needs.

The conference spanned across several days and the recorded sessions are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=open+source+data+stack+conference" target=_>YouTube</a>:<br class = "custom">
