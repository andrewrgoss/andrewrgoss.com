There's a lot you can learn about a website by simply having the URL address.

Who Is Hosting This
-------------------

<!--![WhoIsHostingThis.com](http://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v98/images/wiht-logo.png)-->

For a long time, I looked at websites owned by either companies or individuals and wondered who the web hosting provider was; who was responsible for powering the website? No more. <a href="http://www.whoishostingthis.com" target="_blank">WhoIsHostingThis</a> allows a user to simply enter the domain name of any site and instantly uncover the identity of the company that is hosting the site. For example, I follow a web developer at HubSpot on Twitter by the name of Jonathan Kim. I've read his personal blog several times and wondered who he chose for his provider. After all, he is a developer at a marketing company and so I figured he might be interested in a hosting company that could provide advanced analytics as part of their package.

Turns out my hunches were at least partially right. WhoIsHostingThis.com showed me that Kim is powering his personal blog by a web hosting company called CloudFlare. While there was not a review particular for this particular provider, it drove me to visit the website of this hosting company that I was not previously familiar with. Although CloudFlare does provide insight into website traffic, its biggest draw seems to be that it is designed to be a community for webmasters. It protects and accelerates websites by blocking threats and limiting bots and crawlers from wasting bandwidth and server resources.

Using WhoIsHostingThis.com has given me useful insight about web hosting that should prove valuable to me when it comes time to selecting a web hosting provider for my own personal website. Also of note, the IP address is displayed. There are lots of IP address services across the web that allow a user to pinpoint the location of the server that is powering any given website. In this case, CloudFlare's servers are located at the company's headquarters in San Francisco. I may explore IP addresses a bit further in a future blog post.
