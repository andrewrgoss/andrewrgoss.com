### What is Ruby?
* An object-oriented programming language
* A popular language across the world
* Released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz")
* Open-source project in development today
* Available for both Windows and Mac OS operating systems

### Ruby Design Principles
* Ruby is a <b>high-level</b> programming language.
* Ruby is an <b>interpreted language</b>. It does not need to be compiled.
* Ruby code is read top-to-bottom, line by line.
* The program that runs the Ruby code is called the <b>interpreter</b>.
* Everything in Ruby is an object.
* Ruby is <b>dynamically typed</b>. Variable types do not have to be declared. The same variable can be reassigned to an object of another data type.
* Strings are mutable objects.

### Syntax Best Practices
* Variable names should start with a lowercase letter or underscore
* Use underscores (lower_snake_case)
