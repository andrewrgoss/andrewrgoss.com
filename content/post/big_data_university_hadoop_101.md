Reinforcing some of the basics of Apache Hadoop, a free, open source, Java-based programming framework. Topics in this course include:

* Hadoop's architecture and core components, such as MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
* Adding/removing nodes from Hadoop clusters, how to check available disk space on each node, and how to modify configuration parameters.
* Other Apache projects that are part of the Hadoop ecosystem, including Pig, Hive, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Sqoop, Flume, among others.
