Reinforcing some of the basics of Apache Hadoop, a free, open source, Java-based programming framework. Topics in this course include:

* Hadoop's architecture and core components, such as MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
* Adding/removing nodes from Hadoop clusters, how to check available disk space on each node, and how to modify configuration parameters.
* Other Apache projects that are part of the Hadoop ecosystem, including Pig, Hive, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Sqoop, Flume, among others.

The course provides an IBM cloud sandbox environment to perform lab exercises, such as using the HDFS command line:
