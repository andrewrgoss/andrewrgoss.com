My goal in taking this course was to expand upon my knowledge around Apache Hadoop, a free, open source, Java-based programming framework. Topics in this course include:

* Hadoop's architecture and core components, such as MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
* Adding/removing nodes from Hadoop clusters, how to check available disk space on each node, and how to modify configuration parameters.
* Other Apache projects that are part of the Hadoop ecosystem, including Pig, Hive, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Sqoop, Flume, among others.

The course provides video lectures, diagrams, and an IBM cloud sandbox environment to practice administering a Hadoop cluster and performing tasks such as adding and removing nodes. Additionally, the course provides instructions for connecting to the cloud environment via a SFTP client or a SSH client, the latter through which you can practice using the HDFS command line:
