For 3 days in May 2016 I will be attending my first <a href="https://www.odsc.com" target="_blank">Open Data Science Conference</a> in Boston. There will be 3,000+ data science practioners coming together at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center to share ideas about this rapidly changing discipline. I'm looking forward to writing more of my thoughts here following the conference.

Topics that will be covered include:

* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Analytics
* Python
* Stan
* R
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Scikit-learn
* Julia
