In May 2016 I attended my first <a href="https://www.odsc.com" target="_blank">Open Data Science Conference</a> in Boston. There were some 3,000+ data science practioners that came together at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center to share ideas about this rapidly changing discipline. The following topics were covered throughout the conference:

* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Analytics
* Python
* Stan
* R
* Julia
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Processing

I attended sessions on popular data science statistical models and using Python for data science, where we worked through <a href="https://github.com/brianbelljr/fantasy_football/blob/master/football.ipynb" target="_blank">this example</a>.

The workshop materials from the conference are available on <a href="https://www.opendatascience.com/category/conferences" target="_blank">opendatascience.com</a>.
