Working on furthering my Python skills in the following areas:

* Algorithm Analysis and Big-O Notation
* Array Sequences
* Stacks Queues and Deques
* Linked Lists
* Recursion
* Trees
* Searching and Sorting Algorithms
* Graph Algorithms
* Jupyter Notebooks

Additionally, this course focuses on some of the 'soft skills' needed to advance a career in technology such as personal branding, building a strong professional network, and practicing technical questions that could be asked on a future interview.
