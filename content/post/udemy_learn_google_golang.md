<a href="https://golang.org" target="_blank">Go (Golang)</a> is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. I first started using Go through my work at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>. My department adopted this language as one of our tech stacks for the following reasons:

* It’s open source (i.e. free) and intended to be simple yet expressive.
* It’s intended to be a good middleware layer to provide for both quick one-off applications as well as large collaborative code bases.
* It's a static simple language, which allows for static analysis tooling and fast compilation.
* It can easily be compiled across multiple platforms, which is important for us since we host several different commercial and open source operating systems.
* It's based around composition instead of OOP inheritance, which avoids a whole bunch of potential issues. For example, there's no type casting hell. Things are either a type or not.
* Objects and functionality can easily be combined. Structs provide simple blue-prints. Interfaces provide a lightweight polymorphism without complicating things too much.
* Concurrency is built in through Go routines and channels, which are a simple and efficient means to run multiple executions at once.

My goal in taking this course is to strengthen my knowledge around the fundamentals of the Go programming language and to get more practice.
