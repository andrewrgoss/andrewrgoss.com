As a new data engineering manager, I appreciate a bird's eye view into how other data teams are structured. Fortunately, some organizations like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com" target=_>GitLab</a> have published their data manifestos online for all to see. By doing so, GitLab stands to gain some important benefits and has given back to the data community by:

* Fostering collaboration between companies
* Ensuring knowledge sharing and the broader advancement of technologies and processes in the data space
* Holding themselves accountable to constantly iterating and improving their platform and team culture
* Opening them up to feedback and outside perspectives that wouldn't otherwise be available
* Serving as a valuable recruiting and onboarding asset by being upfront about prospective hires will be working on
