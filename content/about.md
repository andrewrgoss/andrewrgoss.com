> <b>TL;DR</b> -- Data engineer and software developer building business intelligence and programmatic media applications in the marketing/advertising industry.

My career has been tied closely to the convergence of marketing and technology (martech) and the ever-increasing reliance on data at the heart of it all. With petabytes of data being generated at every turn through digital interactions, I work to wrangle this data and derive value from it.

I am currently a senior software engineer at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>.

* My team uses a variety of evolving technologies to build the systems and architectures behind SaaS tools used by global data science, marketing, and media management teams.
* Using both traditional RDBMS and newer open source software frameworks like Hadoop, we integrate disparate sources of structured and semi-structured data. In centralizing data streams, we help provide the structure and visualization necessary to enable crucial cross-platform analytics and automated advertising decisioning. 

Over the past 6+ years I have gained experience as both a developer and a marketer in leveraging people, process, and technology.

* I've held both client-facing and technical roles while addressing a wide range of business initiatives across industries such as finance, food services, higher education, retail, technology, and telecommunications. 
* During this time I've worked with numerous high-profile <a href="/resume/#clients_served">clients</a> including Bank of America, Fitbit, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Sprint, and Taco Bell.
* My cross-functional <a href="/resume/#work_experience">roles</a> have included data engineering, application development, business analysis, database marketing, and marketing automation. I've helped translate large amounts of fragmented data into smarter, real-time optimization of marketing/advertising dollars through technical expertise combined with marketing savviness and business acumen. 

With the rate at which technology changes, you can never stop learning new things. I take a proactive approach towards career growth and skill development that I write about in this blog. I've found it not only to be a nice way to document my work, but also a great way to share knowledge with others. I've also come across many useful <a href="/resources">resources</a> and emerging ideas that I <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrgoss" target="_blank">tweet</a> about regularly.

Outside of work, I am a world traveler.

* To date, I have traveled to over 20 countries. In the summer of 2017, my wife and I took a 7-week sabbatical to travel throughout Japan and Southeast Asia.

I also like to read.

* <a href="/books">Here</a> are some of the books I am reading or have read in the past.

And I'm an investor, gamer, and a fantasy sports nerd.

* Also a real-life sports fan. <a href="http://www.patriots.com">New England Patriots</a> season ticket holder since 2012.
