I've spent most of my career as a consultant in the marketing & advertising industry. I've held both business and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous verticals including finance, higher education, insurance, and commercial software. Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

My unique combination of hard and soft skills is what makes me different and something I take pride in. Early in my career, I gained experience building out marketing campaigns using automation platforms such as <a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, 
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a> (acquired by Oracle), and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a> (acquired by Teradata). I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind these marketing technologies and quickly showed an aptitude for it. 

Writing - started this blog to keep my writing skills sharp.
