<!--Blog post ideas:
- Building my first virtual machine (Ubuntu)
- Why I started programming in Go (server side language)
- Website iterations I went through (templates, Google App Engine, Wordpress, etc.)
- Why it is important to have a web presence as a developer
- Why starting a blog/personal website has been hard for me (no one cares what I have to say?). Important to have 'home base' for personal brand and put thoughts, learnings down as I navigate my career.
	"I think the 'About' page of any website is the most important one, yet it's also the one that is the hardest to write. I've looked at tons of these pages on personal websites over the years. Like any writing piece, you need to start with something compelling to convince the person viewing the content to keep reading. Don't want to be self-aggrandizing."
- Twitter API authentication for Go
- Coding practice sites
- The need to come up with a design before starting development (eliminating communication gaps with business team) 
- Top travel photos (my favorites)-->

Hey, I'm Andrew. I've spent most of my career as a consultant at marketing & advertising agencies. I've held both business and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous industries such as finance, food & beverage, higher education, and technology. Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

![Correlsense](/img/Correlsense_logo.png "Correlsense")
![Diversified Communications](/img/DBC_logo.png "Diversified Communications")
![Education Management Corporation](/img/EDMC_logo.png "Education Management Corporation")
![HP Inc.](/img/HP_logo.png "HP Inc.")
![Hewlett Packard Enterprise](/img/HPE_logo.png "Hewlett Packard Enterprise")
![Reed Elsevier](/img/Reed_Elsevier_logo.png "Reed Elsevier")
![Taco Bell](/img/TB_logo.png "Taco Bell")
![Universal Technical Institute](/img/UTI_logo.jpg "Universal Technical Institute")

Early in my career, I gained experience building out marketing campaigns using automation platforms such as <a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, 
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a> (acquired by Oracle), and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a> (acquired by Teradata). I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind these marketing technologies and quickly showed an aptitude for it. 

Writing - started this blog to keep my writing skills sharp. Establishing a personal brand. Centralize all of my thoughts in one place. Measure progress.

Another characteristic that sets me apart is my strong desire to never stop learning. I set up the 'Learning' section of this website to document and track my progress in learning new concepts and abilities. Always reading articles and staying on top of trends.

Many clients I've worked with over the years are trying to address similar problems. There's a deluge of data available, and businesses know they need to be using it to make smarter marketing/advertising decisions. However, the data is typically fragmented across disparate datasets. Often times, these are siloed within the organization.

There's too much manual work going on. You'd think this would only be happening at smaller companies, but it happens at larger ones too. A lot of this stems from not knowing of a better approach, or people being too fearful of being automated out of a job. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/insightful-applications-the-next-inflection-in-big-data" target="_blank">Link</a> to blog post on data warehousing.

Bridge the gap between business and technical. Versatility. My unique combination of hard and soft skills is what makes me different and something I take pride in.
