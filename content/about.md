> <b>TL;DR</b> -- Data engineer, technical consultant, and business intelligence developer working to solve analytical challenges at the intersection of marketing and technology.

Hey! I'm Andrew Goss. Thanks for checking out my website. My career has been tied closely to the convergence of marketing and advertising technology (martech and adtech) and the ever-increasing reliance on data at the heart of it all. Companies across the world have fundamentally shifted how they spend their marketing dollars and messaging is now at the individual level, where data-driven unique messages are being communicated across social media channels, publisher sites, personalized emails, video content, instant messaging... the list goes on and on in the digital sphere. With petabytes of data being collected at every turn through digital and offline interactions, I work to wrangle this data and derive value from it.

## My Background

I am currently a manager for Media Systems and Technology at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>, where we use a variety of evolving technologies to build the systems and architectures behind business intelligence tools used extensively by global analytic teams and clients. Through the use of data science, our teams summarize the data story for each client in order to measure campaign effectiveness, apply predictive modeling, and ultimately influence consumer brand affiliations and buying patterns.

Over the past 5+ years I have gained experience as both a developer and a marketer in leveraging people, process, and technology. I've held both client-facing and technical roles while addressing a wide range of business initiatives across industries such as finance, higher education, retail, technology, and telecommunications. During this time I've worked with numerous high-profile companies including Bank of America, EDMC, Fitbit, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Sprint, and Reed Elsevier. In supporting these organizations, my cross-functional roles have included data engineering, ETL scripting, database design, application development, business intelligence reporting, database marketing, and marketing automation. 

I help clients translate large amounts of fragmented data into smarter optimization of marketing/advertising dollars through technical expertise combined with human marketing savviness and business acumen. As a consultant, I strive to consistently provide quality ongoing services, on-time deliverables, and open communication around project status, risks, and challenges. I am results-oriented, well-organized, self-motivated, and I work to build strong relationships with my clients and team members.

With the rate at which technology changes, you can never stop learning new things. I take a proactive approach towards career growth and skill development through a dedicated effort towards continuing education that I write about in this blog. I've come across many great <a href="/resources">resources</a> and ideas that I <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrgoss" target="_blank">tweet</a> about regularly.
