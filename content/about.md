Hi, I'm Andrew Goss. I've spent my career immersed in marketing and technology, [two disciplines that are more intertwined](/tags/martech) than they've ever been. I'm a business/technology hybrid in this new world and I can help you navigate the challenges associated with this increasingly sophisticated ecosystem. [Learn more](#problems_i_solve) about problems I help organizations with, or read on to hear about my career path to this point.

## My Background

I've spent most of my career as a consultant at marketing & advertising agencies, holding both client-facing and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous industries such as finance, food & beverage, higher education, and technology. I've been on both sides of the fence in terms of marketing and IT departments, but that 'fence' isn't much of a divider like it used to be. It's already starting to happen in some cases, but I would contend that we're going to start seeing more and more organizations that structure themselves with an IT arm within marketing, or perhaps an IT branch that is dedicated to serving marketing/advertising capabilities. I currently fall in the former but I've been in the latter too, more on that in a bit.

I got my start out of college as a marketer and early on, I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. During this time, I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind behind the marketing automation tools (<a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a>, and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a>) I was using. I really started getting into computer programming and quickly showed an aptitude towards learning the technologies that power these platforms. I read any technology article I could get my hands on.

Marketing software companies were (and still are) blowing up all over the place too. I followed the local startup, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>, as it rocketed from a tiny unknown in Cambridge to a publicly-traded global powerhouse. Other companies sprung up to fill niches in this fast-growing space and the marketplace soon exploded to look like <a href="http://chiefmartec.com/2016/03/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2016" target="_blank">this</a>. And that graphic doesn't cover everything, such as all of the infrastructure categories (databases, cloud infrastructure, big data, web dev).

This is an exciting, challenging, complex field to be a part of. Following my start as a marketer using automation software, I became a technical consultant with a focus on ETL development for HP (and later on, HPE following their split into two separate entities). Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

I'm currently a manager on the Media Systems and Technology team at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>. I help tame the tsunami of big data with real-time optimization and personalization combined with human marketing expertise and judgment. My unique combination of hard and soft skills is what makes me different and something I take pride in. I aim to be versatile in bridging the gap between business and technical disciplines. I go beyond just coding and setting up automated processes. I work to understand the data through deep dives and proactively identify anomalies and other patterns. As the architect in setting everything up, I have a different level of understanding. It's my job to call things out and facilitate communication rather than discovering an issue 8 months down the road. I am a very well-organized project manager.

Another characteristic that sets me apart is my strong desire to never stop seeking new knowledge. I set up the [Learning](/learning) section of this website to document and track my progress in learning important concepts and abilities. I'm always reading articles and trying to stay on top of trends. I <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrgoss" target="_blank">tweet</a> lots of links to these regularly so others can also check out these interesting stories. There is still so much I don't know, but learning new things fuels me and excites me. I'm always hungry to keep learning through online materials and conversations with smart people. It's one of my biggest reasons for working in marketing and technology. 

I started this blog not only as a personal branding tool but also a place to centralize my thoughts, to measure progress, and keep my writing skills sharp. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better, now let's talk about some specific problems I can help with.

## <a name="problems_i_solve"></a>Problems I Solve

Many clients I've worked with over the years are trying to address similar issues. There's a deluge of data available, and businesses know they need to be using it to make smarter marketing/advertising decisions. However, the data is typically fragmented across disparate datasets. Often times, these are siloed within the organization. Everyone wants the holistic, 360-view of a person's interactions with the company to create a better end user experience. But there's no centralized repository. And there's not a standardized way of working with the data, too many people following their own methods instead of a documented process. When people leave the organization, things get lost in translation. There ends up being legacy programs and processes that no longer get used, often with poor documentation (or none at all). It's too risky or impossible to start over, so things get built on top of each other. Eventually the system becomes an entangled mess of files and code.

There's too much manual work going on. You'd think this would only be happening at smaller companies, but it happens at larger ones too. A lot of this stems from not knowing of a better approach, or people being too fearful of being automated out of a job. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/insightful-applications-the-next-inflection-in-big-data" target="_blank">Link</a> to blog post on data warehousing.
