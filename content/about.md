I am currently a data engineer at <a href="https://www.interfolio.com" target="_blank">Interfolio</a>.

* Interfolio is an enterprise SaaS collaboration platform serving the global higher education market.
* I'm working to advance a data-driven culture by integrating disparate data sources and empowering end users to uncover key insights that tell a bigger story.

Over the course of my career, I have gained a unique perspective as both a developer and a marketer in leveraging people, process, and technology.

* I've held both client-facing and technical roles while addressing a wide range of business data initiatives across industries such as finance, food services, higher education, retail, technology, and telecommunications. 
* During this time I've worked with numerous high-profile <a href="/resume/#clients_served">clients</a> including Bank of America, Fitbit, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Sprint, and Taco Bell.
* My cross-functional <a href="/resume/#work_experience">roles</a> have included data engineering, application development, business analysis, database marketing, and marketing automation. I've helped translate large amounts of fragmented data into smarter decision making.

With the rate at which technology changes, you can never stop learning new things. I take a proactive approach towards career growth and skill development that I write about in this blog. I've found it not only to be a nice way to document my work, but also a great way to share knowledge with others. I've also come across many useful <a href="/resources">resources</a> and emerging ideas that I <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrgoss" target="_blank">tweet</a> about regularly.

Outside of work, I am a <a href="/travel">world traveler</a>.

* To date, I have traveled to over 20 countries. In the summer of 2017, my wife and I took a 7-week sabbatical to travel throughout Japan and Southeast Asia.

I also like to read.

* Here are some of the <a href="/books">books</a> I am reading, want to read, or have read in the past.

And I'm an investor, gamer, and sports fan.
