I've spent most of my career as a consultant in the marketing & advertising industry. I've held both business and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous verticals including finance, higher education, insurance, and commercial software. Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

My unique combination of hard and soft skills is what makes me different and something I take pride in. Early in my career, I gained experience building out marketing campaigns using automation platforms such as <a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, 
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a> (acquired by Oracle), and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a> (acquired by Teradata). I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind these marketing technologies and quickly showed an aptitude for it. 

Writing - started this blog to keep my writing skills sharp.

Data engineer and business intelligence developer in the marketing & advertising industry. Skilled in developing and supporting crucial back-end functionality behind data-driven applications. Enabler of advanced analytics towards reaching the right audience at the right time. Designs, builds, and deploys information system programs across software development life cycles. Technical aptitude is complimented by a strong business acumen originating from a career that began in client marketing services. Top-notch consultant and project manager with a mindset towards identifying and solving challenging business problems. Consistently provides quality ongoing services, on-time deliverables, and open communication around project status, risks, and challenges. Takes proactive approach towards career growth and skill development. Results-oriented, well-organized, self-motivated, and effective team member.

Another characteristic that sets me apart is my strong desire to never stop learning. I set up the 'Learning' section of this website to document and track my progress in learning new concepts and abilities.
