Hi, I'm Andrew Goss. I've spent my career immersed in marketing and technology, [two disciplines that are more intertwined](/tags/martech) than they've ever been. I'm a business/technology hybrid in this new world and I can help you navigate the challenges associated with this increasingly sophisticated ecosystem.

## My Background

I've been on both sides of the fence in terms of marketing and IT departments, but that 'fence' is less of a divider than it used to be. It's already starting to happen in some cases, but I would contend that we're going to start seeing more and more organizations that structure themselves with an IT arm within marketing, or perhaps an IT branch that is dedicated to serving marketing/advertising capabilities. I currently fall in the latter, more on that in a bit.

I got my start out of college as a marketer and early on, I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. During this time, I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind behind the marketing automation tools (<a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a>, and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a>) I was using. I really started getting into computer programming and quickly showed an aptitude towards learning the technologies that power these platforms. I read any marketing technology article I could get my hands on.

Marketing software companies were blowing up all over the place too. I followed the local startup, HubSpot, as it rocketed from a tiny unknown in Cambridge to a publicly-traded global powerhouse. Other companies sprung up to fill niches in this fast-growing space and the marketplace soon exploded to look like this: (link to Scott Brinker diagram).

I decided to hitch my wagon to this phenomenon and went all-in. 

Help get data to where it needs to be, and make sense of it too.

Computational marketing can leverage the tsunami of big data with real-time experimentation, optimization, and personalization — intertwined with human marketing expertise and judgment — to transform this industry over the next 10 years. homogeneous mixture

Thanks to the economies of cloud computing, these computational marketing capabilities will not be limited to a handful of the Fortune 500. Marketers of any size will be able to utilize them — if they know how.

Portrait of a Chief Marketing Technologist:

* A business/technology hybrid
* Strong engineering, IT skill set
* Early adopter & pragmatist
* Lives & breathes marketing

And the value of developing such innate technical savvy will only increase as scale and scope of marketing technology grows.

One of the most fascinating fields of research today is at the intersection of computer science and marketing. 

Bridge the gap between business and technical. Versatility. My unique combination of hard and soft skills is what makes me different and something I take pride in.

* Business intelligence development. My focus is on distilling business rules/workflows and translating these into code. This involves a lot of data modeling work under close coordination with client teams.
* Automation engineering. This is where I automate common work patterns and tedious data-oriented tasks. This frees up internal analysts to work more efficiently and focus energies on deeper, more challenging insights. And to do so with clean, manageable data.
* API and data integrations. This is where I work to combine many disparate sources into a holistic view of the client's marketing ecosystem and its touchpoints with each intended audience member. For instance, I've utilized real-time data, such as weather APIs, to enable customized marketing offers. 

I also support various applications, data visualization tools, and host server environments.

Impeccable organization.

I go beyond just coding and setting up automated processes. I work to understand the data too and identify anomalies. As the architect in setting everything up, I have a different level of understanding. It's my job to call things out and facilitate communication rather than discovering an issue 8 months down the road.

I've spent most of my career as a consultant at marketing & advertising agencies working closely with big data. I've held both client-facing and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous industries such as finance, food & beverage, higher education, and technology. Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

I'm currently a manager on the Media Systems and Technology team at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>.

Prior to this, I spent 3.5 years at <a href="http://www.quickpivot.com" target="_blank">QuickPivot</a>, a marketing automation software company.

Writing - started this blog to keep my writing skills sharp. Establishing a personal brand. Centralize all of my thoughts in one place. Measure progress.

Another characteristic that sets me apart is my strong desire to never stop learning. I set up the 'Learning' section of this website to document and track my progress in learning new concepts and abilities. Always reading articles and staying on top of trends.

There is still so much I don't know, but learning new things fuels me and excites me. It's one of my biggest reasons for working with technology. I'm always hungry to keep learning through online materials and conversations with smart people.

## <a name="problems_i_solve"></a>Problems I Solve

Many clients I've worked with over the years are trying to address similar issues. There's a deluge of data available, and businesses know they need to be using it to make smarter marketing/advertising decisions. However, the data is typically fragmented across disparate datasets. Often times, these are siloed within the organization. Everyone wants the holistic, 360-view of a person's interactions with the company to create a better end user experience. But there's no centralized repository. And there's not a standardized way of working with the data, too many people following their own methods instead of a documented process. When people leave the organization, things get lost in translation. There ends up being legacy programs and processes that no longer get used, often with poor documentation (or none at all). It's too risky or impossible to start over, so things get built on top of each other. Eventually the system becomes an entangled mess of files and code.

There's too much manual work going on. You'd think this would only be happening at smaller companies, but it happens at larger ones too. A lot of this stems from not knowing of a better approach, or people being too fearful of being automated out of a job. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/insightful-applications-the-next-inflection-in-big-data" target="_blank">Link</a> to blog post on data warehousing.
