Hi, I'm Andrew Goss. I've spent my career immersed in marketing and technology, two disciplines that are more intertwined than they've ever been. I'm a business/technology hybrid in this new world and I can help you navigate the challenges associated with this increasingly sophisticated ecosystem. [Learn more](#problems_i_solve) about problems I help organizations with, or read on to hear about my career path to this point.

## My Background

I've spent most of my career as a consultant at marketing & advertising agencies, holding both client-facing and technical roles in this space while providing services across numerous industries such as finance, higher education, and technology. I've been on both sides of the fence in terms of marketing and IT departments, but that 'fence' isn't much of a divider like it used to be. It's already starting to happen in some cases, but I would contend that we're going to start seeing more and more organizations that structure themselves with an IT arm within marketing, or perhaps an IT branch that is dedicated to serving marketing/advertising capabilities. I currently fall in the former but I've been in the latter too, more on that in a bit.

I got my start out of college as a marketer and early on, I developed core consulting skills in interfacing directly with clients and being able to summarize and present key performance metrics. During this time, I also gravitated towards wanting to further understand the backend functionality behind behind the marketing automation tools (<a href="https://www.marketo.com" target="_blank">Marketo</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel/marketing-to-businesses.html" target="_blank">Eloqua</a>, and <a href="http://marketing.teradata.com" target="_blank">Aprimo</a>) I was using. I really started getting into computer programming and quickly showed an aptitude towards learning the technologies that power these platforms. I read any technology article I could get my hands on.

Marketing software companies were (and still are) blowing up all over the place too. I followed the local startup, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>, as it rocketed from a tiny unknown in Cambridge to a publicly-traded global powerhouse. Other companies sprung up to fill niches in this fast-growing space and the marketplace soon exploded to look like <a href="http://chiefmartec.com/2016/03/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2016" target="_blank">this</a>. And that graphic doesn't even cover everything, such as all of the infrastructure categories (databases, cloud infrastructure, big data, web dev).

Following my start as a marketer using automation software, I became a technical consultant with a focus on ETL development for HP (and later on, HPE following their split into two separate entities). Here are some of the clients I've worked with over the years:

I'm currently a manager on the Media Systems and Technology team at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>. I help tame the tsunami of big data with real-time optimization and personalization combined with human marketing expertise and judgment. I aim to be versatile in bridging the gap between business and technical disciplines and my unique combination of hard and soft skills is something I take pride in. I go beyond coding and setting up automated processes. I work to analyze big data through deep dives and proactively identify anomalies and other patterns. As the architect in building new system processes (or being able to translate legacy code into business logic), I have a different level of understanding. It's my job to call things out and facilitate communication rather than discovering an issue 8 months down the road. I am a very well-organized project manager.

I'm a big believer in the idea that one should never stop seeking new knowledge. I use the [Learning](/learning) section of this website to document and track my progress in learning important concepts and furthering my abilities. It also makes it easy to go back and reference materials. I'm always reading articles and following the thought leaders to stay on top of trends. I <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewrgoss" target="_blank">tweet</a> lots of links regularly so others can also read about these ever-shifting [martech](/tags/martech) patterns shaping businesses. And of course, I never underestimate the power of asking questions and seeking mentorship from the smart people I work with and across the industry.

I started this blog not only as a personal branding tool but also a place to centralize my thoughts, to measure progress, and keep my writing skills sharp. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better, now let's talk about some specific problems I can help with. You can also check out my [LinkedIn](/resume) profile for more details on my professional background or you can learn more about my specific [skillset](/skills).

## <a name="problems_i_solve"></a>Problems I Solve

I've found that many clients I've worked with over the years are trying to address fairly similar issues (albeit within far different business contexts) from a high-level perspective when it comes to technology solutions for their marketing and advertising intiatives. There's a deluge of data available and businesses know they need to be using it to make smarter decisions in reaching their target audiences about their brand. However, the data is typically fragmented across disparate datasets. Often times, these are siloed within the organization itself and there isn't always a way to easily join the data together to tell the full story. Further exasperating the problem is the fact that the data hygiene is lousy. Sales reps at the end of the pipeline complain about the quality of the leads they are trying to work with. Or analysts complain that when evaluating the effectiveness of advertising content that their results are skewed. Or their reports are taking forever to run (unbeknownst to them this is because of poorly-tuned databases on the backend). Through the implementation of comprehensive business rules and well thought-out architecture and procedural scripts, I help alleviate these data challenges.

Everyone wants the holistic, 360-view of a person's interactions with the company to create a better end user experience. But there's no centralized repository and no standardized way of working with the data. Lack of documentation can be a problem too, with many people following their own methods instead of a formalized process. When people leave the organization, things get lost in translation. There ends up being legacy programs and processes that no longer get used but since it's too risky or impossible to start over, things get built on top of each other. Eventually the system becomes an entangled mess of files and code. I can't predict future use for the programs I develop but I always try to emphasize clean, readable code that is easily configurable (through the use of parameters and such) with anticipation that needs will inevitably change.

Lastly, there's too much manual work going on. You'd think this would only be happening at smaller companies, but it happens at larger ones too. A lot of this stems from people not knowing of a better approach or simply being set in their ways. I'm the guy shouting from the rooftops that anything remotely repititive should be automated. This frees up resources to focus their time on more meaningful insights that drive business impact and reduces the potential for human error.
