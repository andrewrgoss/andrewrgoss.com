#### GAME RULES:
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his/her ROUND score gets added to the GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
