<hr>

As part of the popular Harvard University course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!" target="_blank">CS50x</a> that I took through EdX, I built a small <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> application in completing the first <a href="http://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/psets/0/pset0.html" target="_blank">problem set</a>.

Scratch is a 'language' wherein you create programs by dragging together and connecting “blocks”. Unlike other programming languages, Scratch is very visual, making it a good first project for building fundamentals and learning to think like a programmer.

Please note that Scratch requires Flash to run and thus you won't be able to view it live from your mobile device or tablet.
