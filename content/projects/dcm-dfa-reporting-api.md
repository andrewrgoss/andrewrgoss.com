<a href="/projects/">Projects</a> >> <b>Google DCM/DFA Reporting/Trafficking API for PostgreSQL</b>
<hr>

This is a Python script I developed for programmatically generating Google DCM/DFA report data and inserting into PostgreSQL. There is additionally the option of running a report that contains floodlight tags - my code flattens this for the PostgreSQL staging table structure.

DCM/DFA Reporting and Trafficking API v2.8 is used in this code. A detailed reference of the API can be accessed <a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/v2.8" target=_>here</a>.
