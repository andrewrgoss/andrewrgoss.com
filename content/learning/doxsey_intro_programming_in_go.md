<a href="https://golang.org" target="_blank">Go (Golang)</a> is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. I first started using Go through my work at <a href="http://www.digitaslbi.com/us" target="_blank">DigitasLBi</a>. My department adopted this language as one of our tech stacks for the following reasons:

* It’s open source (i.e. free) and intended to be simple yet expressive.
* It’s intended to be a good middleware layer to provide for both quick one-off applications as well as large collaborative code bases.
* It's a static simple language, which allows for static analysis tooling and fast compilation.
* It can easily be compiled across multiple platforms, which is important for us since we host several different commercial and open source operating systems.
* It's based around composition instead of OOP inheritance, which avoids a whole class of issues. There's no type casting hell. Things are either a type or not.
* Objects and functionality can easily be combined. Structs provide simple blue-prints. Interfaces provide a lightweight polymorphism without complicating things too much.
* Concurrency is built in through Go routines and channels, which are a simple and efficient means to run multiple executions at once.

My aim in reading this book and completing the accompanying exercises was to gain a thorough understanding on the fundamentals of the Go programming language.
