I've been wanting to add Python to my personal tech stack for some time now as it is a powerful (and popular) all-purpose programming language. It is also one of the most commonly-used languages for analytics, data mining, and data science. 

My goal in taking this course is to build my knowledge around the fundamentals of the language.
